      <h3>Quant Trading App</h3>
      <p>I entered into an options trading competition on the TSX with a colleague. His skill set revolved around portfolio management, whereas I brought to the
        team expertise in mathematical modeling and software engineering. With his direction on general strategy, I was able to put together a web app for mobile 
        and desktop leveraging Streamlit's framework. It has the ability to pull 15-minute delayed data from Yahoo Finance's API and, based on a series of backtested
        strategies, signal good entry points for an investment guide. There is also the capability to use Black-Scholes and Binomial options pricing models on a 
        second page. Features were continually added over the course of the 8-week competition. You can find the full Investment Policy Statement on my LinkedIn 
        and the project description on my GitHub, both linked at the top of this page. </p>

      <h3>Graph Database</h3>
      <p>This project was taken on at CI Financial in a team of two software developers. We build this system from scratch inside AWS Neptune which included all of the infrastructure as well.
      This included but was not limited to Sagemaker notebooks, EC2 instances, access permissions, VPCs and VPC peering. We constructed a full knowledge graph of
      clients that the company manages based on our internal data systems. I took the project a step further using social network analysis to draw trends in our data using harmonic centrality.
      I analyzed the transaction timings to cluster different advisors and derive an information propogation map. This gave us insights into which advisors were
      first to follow a trend, and which ones were then likely to follow similar behaviors thus allowing our sales team to take advantage of this propogation of knowledge. </p>

      <h3>Data Orchestration</h3>
      <p>This is a data pipeline orchestrated by Dagster, leveraging two APIs, Snowflake storage, and a linear regression model. The process reads the top 20 holdings 
        of the S&P 500 index from one API, then sends that data to IEX Cloud's API to retrieve the price history. All historical data is stored in Snowflake and can
        be read on command into a linear regression model to predict future price movements. The results of this model's output are moved to S3, where they can be 
        integrated into various other applications. The motivation for this project was to learn how to leverage a workflow orchestration tool to achieve a level of 
        abstracted control across applications in a large corporate setting. This problem arose in my job, and I decided to experiment with potential technologies 
        as a solution and built out a proof of concept.</p>
