        <h3>Portfolio Optimization</h3>
        <div class="project-dates">01/2024 - Present</div>
      </div>
      <p>This is a large scale project that encompasses fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis and portfolio optimization. It is a tool designed to research 
        various investment strategies (ie. Value, growth, momentum etc.). The user is then able to construct an optimized portfolio based on prebuild methodologies
        with a couple button clicks. There is the ability to add news sentiment data leveraging finbert model through the transformers library to add new data,
        and analyze it using a self-graphing tool on the main page. The project was born out of the need to enable team members of varying technical abilities,
        to have access to cutting edge risk optimization, free online data API's, and machine learning models. If the repo is cloned to local machine,
        (with AMD processors only) the app will seek a connection to a paper trading account associated with IBKR (interactive brokers) Trader Workstation for
        authentication. It has the ability to pull live portfolio holdings details, and feed them into the portfolio optimization tool as well.</p><br>

        <div class="project-dates">09/2023 - 11/2023</div>
      </div>
      <p>I entered into an options trading competition on the TSX with a colleague. His skill set revolved around portfolio management, whereas I brought to the
        team expertise in mathematical modeling and software engineering. With his direction on general strategy, I was able to put together a web app for mobile 
        and desktop leveraging Streamlit's framework. It has the ability to pull 15-minute delayed data from Yahoo Finance's API and, based on a series of backtested
        strategies, signal good entry points for an investment guide. There is also the capability to use Black-Scholes and Binomial options pricing models on a 
        second page. Features were continually added over the course of the 8-week competition. You can find the full Investment Policy Statement on my LinkedIn 
        and the project description on my GitHub, both linked at the top of this page. </p><br>

      </div>
      <p>This project was taken on at CI Financial in a team of two software developers. We build this system from scratch inside AWS Neptune which included all of the infrastructure as well.
      This included but was not limited to Sagemaker notebooks, EC2 instances, access permissions, VPCs and VPC peering. We constructed a full knowledge graph of
      clients that the company manages based on our internal data systems. I took the project a step further using social network analysis to draw trends in our data using harmonic centrality.
      I analyzed the transaction timings to cluster different advisors and derive an information propogation map. This gave us insights into which advisors were
      first to follow a trend, and which ones were then likely to follow similar behaviors thus allowing our sales team to take advantage of this propogation of knowledge. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Tools:</strong><br> jupyter, opencypher, igraph, pandas, AWS Neptune, graph explorer, python, boto3</p>

        <h3>Data Orchestration</h3>
        <div class="project-dates">12/2022 - 01/2023</div>
      </div>
      <p>This is a data pipeline orchestrated by Dagster, leveraging two APIs, Snowflake storage, and a linear regression model. The process reads the top 20 holdings 
        of the S&P 500 index from one API, then sends that data to IEX Cloud's API to retrieve the price history. All historical data is stored in Snowflake and can
        be read on command into a linear regression model to predict future price movements. The results of this model's output are moved to S3, where they can be 
        integrated into various other applications. The motivation for this project was to learn how to leverage a workflow orchestration tool to achieve a level of 
        abstracted control across applications in a large corporate setting. This problem arose in my job, and I decided to experiment with potential technologies 
        as a solution and built out a proof of concept.</p><br>
