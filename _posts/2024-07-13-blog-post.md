I dove into the realm of web scraping recently.. I learned that it is not a simple as making a GET request to their statically hosted html page on the web. On a serious
note though, I learned a lot about harvesting the structure of ld+json ecommerce website data for products (https://schema.org/Product) and how a react application serves static html
compiled from javascript code during node npm run build. I ended up using a free api service (https://www.scrapingbee.com/documentation/) to deal with the webscraping and focused more on the application development
and user workflow.
