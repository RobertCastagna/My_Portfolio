I'm Robert Castagna, a Data Engineer based in Toronto. I specialize in client analytics and administrative reporting. My day-to-day involves building and maintaining data pipelines written in Python. The code is orchestrated in AWS Glue and leverages PySpark for compute optimization. I also spend time developing our new data architecture inside Snowflake as we have undertaken a project to decentralize data at our company. Following best practices and Kimball's methodology for data warehousing, we are working on scalable and deployable infrastructure. I am always looking for ways to improve our existing systems by keeping up to date with new release features, spanning Python 3.11 release notes, Spark 3.X automatic query optimization, and beta features such as dynamic tables in Snowflake.

Outside of work, you will either find me in the gym, on my mtb, or researching and turning the newest tech into a personal project. I follow Formula 1, the NHL, and recently watched the success story of Luke 'the Nuke' Littler, a 16-year-old darts prodigy from London, England, earn himself a spot in the semi-finals of the World Championship.

Most of my projects revolve around finance for good reason. I am passionate about researching the intersection of finance and software engineering. The different ways in which a computer can support an experienced trader or researcher are what can give one person or corporation a first-mover advantage in any new endeavor. Finance is a constantly evolving world, and the speed at which technology is evolving requires me to always be developing and learning new things.
